6. Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Use at least 12–16 characters — longer passwords are much harder to crack.

Mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid common words, names, or sequences like 12345 or qwerty.

Create a passphrase from random words and symbols (e.g., Blue!Tree99Sun@Door).

Never reuse the same password for multiple accounts.

Change passwords immediately if you suspect an account is compromised.

Use a password manager to store and generate secure passwords.

7. Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Short passwords, even if complex, can still be weak.

Adding symbols in unexpected places increases strength.

A mix of random words can be stronger and easier to remember than a random jumble of characters.

Passwords that look “complex” but follow predictable patterns (P@ssw0rd!) are still weak.

Tools like PasswordMeter are helpful for checking weaknesses before using a password.

8. Common Password Attacks
Brute Force Attack

Tries every possible character combination until it finds the correct password.

Longer and more complex passwords take much more time to crack.

Dictionary Attack

Uses a list of common words and known leaked passwords to guess yours.

Adding random characters and symbols makes dictionary attacks less effective.

9. How Password Complexity Affects Security
Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack because each extra character increases the possible combinations.

More character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) make brute-force attacks slower.

Complex passwords are less likely to appear in common password lists, which protects against dictionary attacks.

A simple 8-character password might be cracked in seconds, but a well-made 16-character passphrase could take hundreds of years with current technology.
